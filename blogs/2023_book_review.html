<p>This year’s reading was rather diverse, from romantic fantasy fiction to self-help books. Here are my top picks of 2023:</p>

<dl>
    <dt>Favorite author: Erik Larson</dt>
    <dd>Erik Larson was an easy choice for favorite author of the year as I read 3 of his books.
    <!-- <ul>
        <li>The Splendid and the Vile</li>
        <li>In the Garden of the Beasts</li>
        <li>The Devil in the White City</li>
    </ul>     -->
    Larson is a true historian. When you read his books you become immersed in the time period and context. Reading his books is the easiest way to learn about history by accident.</dd>
    <p><em>The Splendid and the Vile</em> gives insight into the life of Winston Churchill. Churchill lived a fascinating life. Larson dives deep into the personal life of Churchill. The reader can quickly come to the conclusion that Churchill was one of the strangest men to ever live, but he was the right man for the job.</p>

    big words and paints the context and scene of books with ease. He loves to use words that I have never heard of. Thankfully my Kindle has a quick dictionary look up feature.</dd>

<p>Reading doesn’t get old. In the midst of life and all the responsibilities that come with it, reading stays the same. I’m able to enter into a safe space where I can escape from this reality and enter another. I only say this to emphasize that there is great joy in reading. In a time where electronic screens rule, reading is a true solace for the mind and a place to rest and center oneself.</p>

In the garden of beasts

Impactful books
Boomtown
Somewhere there is still a sun

Notable entries
Homegrown: Timothy Mcveigh and the rise of right wing extremism
Lessons in chemistry
Fourth wing and iron flame
Chaos Walking series by Patrick Ness



Notable entries include some romance books, which I’ve never taken part in before:
Lessons in chemistry - fun fact, this is not a book about chemistry
Fourth wing and iron flame - both books are part of the same series by Rebecca Yarros, and while the books are quite “spicy”, Yarros is a great author and it's hard not fall in love with the characters and her writing style. For hardcore fantasy fiction readers, this is probably a no-go. The world building and magic system does not live up to Sanderson or Rothfuss worlds. 
The Chaos Walking series by Patrick Ness - great young adult fiction.
